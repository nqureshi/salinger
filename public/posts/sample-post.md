I went to a Balderton "how to recruit" event last week. While it was mostly pointless, there was an interviewing "expert" who talked about how to ask revealing questions.

I personally feel pretty lost trying to find good non-technical questions to ask people. I'd love to hear suggestions, if anyone has any good tips. 

He gave the following pointers:

- Technical tests are very effective. I think this is something we do pretty well.

- Try to avoid asking hypothetical questions. "How would you come up with a strategy for XYZ". People just recite answers they've learnt.

- Focus on actually examples of previous experience. Don't be afraid to dive into a lot of detail to make sure it's not invented. Ask what role they actually performed - a lot of people tend to talk about their team accomplished. What was their individual involvement? (McKinsey do this a lot. It's somewhat annoying...)

- When you evaluate people (eg in Resumator), try to do it on the basis of actual evidence. What impressive stuff have they achieved? Otherwise, it's too easy to let subconscious biases take over.
