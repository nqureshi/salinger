  content: ! "I went to a Balderton \"how to recruit\" event last week. While it was
    mostly pointless, there was an interviewing \"expert\" who talked about how to
    ask revealing questions.\n\nI personally feel pretty lost trying to find good
    non-technical questions to ask people. I'd love to hear suggestions, if anyone
    has any good tips. \n\nHe gave the following pointers:\n\n- Technical tests are
    very effective. I think this is something we do pretty well.\n\n- Try to avoid
    asking hypothetical questions. \"How would you come up with a strategy for XYZ\".
    People just recite answers they've learnt.\n\n- Focus on actually examples of
    previous experience. Don't be afraid to dive into a lot of detail to make sure
    it's not invented. Ask what role they actually performed - a lot of people tend
    to talk about their team accomplished. What was their individual involvement?
    (McKinsey do this a lot. It's somewhat annoying...)\n\n- When you evaluate people
    (eg in Resumator), try to do it on the basis of actual evidence. What impressive
    stuff have they achieved? Otherwise, it's too easy to let subconscious biases
    take over."
